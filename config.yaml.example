    local: false  # if not provided the script will attempt to determine if this is the server hosting the cert files.
                  # setting local will bypass the check.  local: true will result in webserver being started on this system
                  # to serve certificates to cppm.  If set to false the server at base_url should be providing the webserver.
    web_root: /export/FileDump/certificates/LetsEncrypt  # Only applies if this script is also going to act as a temporary webserver to host the certificate.
    # The above will result in "http://omv.arubalab.net:8080/certs/https-rsa-cppm.arubalab.net.p12" being used as the full path where CPPM can get the https_rsa cert. The actual cert files should exist in the web_root directory.
